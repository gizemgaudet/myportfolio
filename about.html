            <div class="comparance abt"><h5 class="about-h5">I am Gizem Gaudet, a User Experience Designer based in New York City.</h5>
             <p>I was born and raised in Turkey so it's been a long journey and a true transformation since my first day in America.
              My professional background is in Business Analysis and Project Management so I have been working with cross-functional
              teams in collaborative and technology-oriented environments for many years. My past experiences definitely contributed to
              my passion for creating intuitive experiences and led me to become a designer.</p>

              <p>As a Business Analyst, I've worked very closely with designers, developers, architects, internal staff, project stakeholders and SMEs
              to understand and document requirements, functional and design specifications for software development and web application projects.
              What I do now as a designer is just taking it a few steps further by using what I know about the business to build out a design that
              would be most effective in the form of wireframes.</p>

     <h3>Experience design is not just digital design</h3>
     <p>Throughout my career, no matter what role I played I have always been the voice of the stakeholders (internal staff, vendors and customers.)
     I have been responsible for communicating stakeholder’s requirements to the development team and managed to gain a Subject Matter Expertise in any
     project that I was assigned. Even before I realized that what I have been doing was designining experiences I defined and implemented new processes as well
     as enhancements to the numerous existing processes, which resulted in improved efficiency, reduced expenses and in some cases, maximized profit
     by automating some of the outdated manual processes in start-ups and mid to large size companies.</p>

     <h3>How did I transition to design?</h3>
     <p>Making a career change was a serious commitment, it required self-discipline, realistic goal setting, hard work and dedication, but it’s one of the best decisions
     I’ve ever made. I started the journey by taking Graphic Design courses from RISD in 2014 to learn more about visual design and became proficient in Adobe Creative Suite.
     In 2017, I decided to enroll to Bloc’s Design Program because it offered one of the most comprehensive curriculums, weekly one-on-one mentorship sessions, and front-end development skills.
     One of my mentors told me that I pour my heart into anything that I do and pay attention to the details. I certainly gave my 100% to any project that I worked on and truly enjoyed each step of the process.</p>

     <h3>What is my design philosophy?</h3>
     <p>One of my favorite books is 'Flow' by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It is about the key to happiness--finding and doing things that you are passionate about,
     things that give you purpose, which ultimately create an optimal experience and flow. That's how I feel while I am creating. I don't realize how time passes and it
     certainly doesn't feel like work. My design philosophy is minimalisim. I believe that design should be simple, beautiful and effective to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable.
     In my design process, I like to iterate based on the findings of the usability tests and I strongly beleive user research is essential
     in creating any successful product.</p>

     <h3>When I am not behind a computer...</h3>
     <p>In my free time, you can find me visiting animal shelters, reading, hiking, wine tasting, traveling and taking photos. I am also a self-taught artist, specializing
     in oils. I’m currently looking for new opportunities, so please reach out to me and let's talk about how I can contribute to your projects.</p>
