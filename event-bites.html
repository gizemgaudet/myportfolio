       <h3>What is Event Bites?</h3>
        <p>Event Bites is an iOS mobile app to place food delivery and pickup orders for Corporate Events.
          Event Bites allows users to browse nearby caterers for large group events such as corporate meetings
          and office holiday parties with a simple yet functional design.</br>
          <span style="font-weight:bold;">Project Duration:</span> 6 weeks</p>


    <!-- problem statement-->
        <h3>Problem</h3>
         <p> My research and competitive analysis indicated that there were many food
          delivery apps available to users, but very few of them targeted corporate events.
          Our users voiced their pain point of spending a lot of time coordinating holiday parties,
          birthdays, office celebrations and team meetings by calling caterers personally and browsing
          online out of uncurrated options. They mentioned the need for an intuitive app to place an
          order and schedule a delivery for corporate events easily with simple steps on their smartphone
          without having to call caterers.</p>

          <h3>Solution</h3>
           <p>Event Bites iOS mobile app allows users to browse nearby caterers that meet their criteria based on budget
             and dietary constraints that they can place orders for large group events such as corporate meetings
             and holiday parties easily. Users can save their favorite caterers, save multiple delivery locations
             and schedule delivery date and time in advance to view order history, re-order a past order
             and check out quickly.</p>


    <!-- goal statement-->

        <h3>Goals</h3>
         <ul class="paragraph-list">
           <li>Create a mobile app design that targets food delivery and pickup for corporate events and office holiday parties.</li>
           <li>Create an intuitive experience that allows users to place an order and schedule a delivery for large groups easily.</li>
           <li>Design a brand identity that resembles the concept of events, fun and celebration.</li>
         </ul>

    <!-- my apporach-->
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
          <p>I took it from concept to creating Event Bites’ brand identity and finalized
         the design with a high-fidelity prototype to translate our users’ needs into a compelling mobile experience by iterating on low-fidelity wireframes.
         The Usability Testing gave me the insights to improve my initial design based on users' pain points and desires.
         My guiding principle was reviewing commonly received feedback and making changes in my final design accordingly.</p>

        <h3>User Research and Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHO IS OUR AUDIENCE?</span></span></br>
        The survey audience was a mix group of individuals from students to engineers, consultants and event managers.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">55%</span> of them were between the ages of 25-34.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">36%</span> of them were of them were between the ages of 35-44 years old.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">55%</span> of them used these apps monthly.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">18%</span> of them used them weekly and the remaining of them used these apps daily, annually or never.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">64%</span> of them used it for individual orders and the remaining of them used it for company meetings, family events and dinner clubs.</p>

        <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHAT DO THEY USE?</span></span></br>
        <span style="font-weight:bold;">64%</span> of our audience was using Grubhub.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">64%</span> Approximately 28% was using Uber Eats.
        </br>The remaining audience was using methods such as calling and talking to caterers on the phone to order, by visiting their websites to order online and a
        small number of them were using DoorDash.
        </br>I decided to reserach GrubHub, UberEats and DoorDash as the competitors.</p>

        <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHAT DO THEY LOOK FOR?</span></span></br>
        Users liked similar apps because they found them to be quick and fast in delivery, they liked that their delivery information
        was saved for future use, they liked being able to track their orders and having vegetarian and vegan options available to them.
        They thought that these apps had an easy-to-use interface. I decided on must-have features of Event Bites app based on their likes.
        </br><span style="font-weight:bold;">18% </span>of the audience mentioned using social sign in while using similar apps.
        </br>I decided to offer Facebook to connect option to sign in and to create an account.</p>

          <li>Their advantage is brand recognition and their repetition to be an environment friendly delivery app, which atracts environment friendly corporate offices.</li>

          <li>They give their users the ability to create group orders (for ordering at work or with friends and after the order has been placed, everyone involved can track it),
          which atracts corporate offices.</li>
          <li>They are new in the market so their brand is weak and they can't charge the same prices as it's well known competitors.</li>

          <li>They have filtering for speed, price and dietary constraints and their real-time tracking via map, 30-minute delivery and popular options close by are most liked features.</li>
          <li>They have a broad cuisine selection and the brand recognition. However, there is a perception as them being environmentally unfriendly and they are known to be expensive.</li>

       <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Users wanted an easy way to re-order an existing order via order history. They preffered to pay by credit card, but they wanted to pay tip by cash upon delivery or pickup.
         They wanted to search and view caterers both in map and list view with following filtering options:</p>
         <ul class="paragraph-list">
          <li>Ability to filter caterers by minimum amount required, caterers by ratings, dietary constraints.</li>
          <li>Ability to place event based pre-orders by providing delivery date/time.</li>
          <li>Ability to enter event delivery and order instructions.</li>
         </ul>

        <h3>User Stories and User Flows</h3>
        <p>Based on the key takeaways I documented the user stories and prioritized them as High, Medium and Low. The High and Medium priority stories defined MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for Event Bites.
        Below you can see High and Medium priority user stories.</p>

         <p>Creating the sitemap and drawing the user flow diagrams allowed me to create the first version of the low fidelity wireframes. I updated the
         initial user flows and the site map after the usability testing. Below you can see Create Account, Sign In and Update Account Settings user flows.</p>

      <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
        <p>I sketched some of the main user flows on paper and then created a low fidelity wireframe in Sketch to visualize them. As a result of the feedback that I received I made revisions and created a second version of the low fidelity wireframes
        in Adobe XD. The changes I made during first iteration are listed below.</p>

              <li>Users were confused about the drop down located at top navigation, which was designed to update delivery location and event details.
              I redesigned the caterer page to revise this concept and reduced the number of options provided to users at top navigation.</li>
              <li>In Reviews page, I decided to use cards for users to submit a new review or to view one of their past reviews
              in order to carry a consistent design throughout the app.</li>
              <li>In tab bar, in addition to bag and account options I added favorites option to allow users to navigate to their
              list of favorite caterers easily.</li>

      <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
       <p>I conducted usability tests with 5 power users with the first version of the prototype. I asked them to perform the following tasks.</p>

  <h3>High Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
    <p> I updated the low-fidelity wireframes based on the Usability Test Results and created the
    high-fidelity wireframes by incorporating the logo and the icons that I created for Event Bites brand.</p>
    <img class="wireframes" src="images/event-bites-high-fidelity.png" alt=""/>
    <div class="button-link">
      <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fbc5e730-e9a2-46a7-a803-fb67332356b5/" target="_blank" class="button">View High Fidelity</a>
    </div>

  <h3>Branding and Style Guide</h3>
   <p> I explored logo ideas for Event Bites by sketching and then drawing in Illustrator. I picked 4 options that
   had a better tie into the word mark Event Bites. I posted them on different channels and performed a preference
   test via UsabilityHub to pick one as a final logo. </p>

   <img class="wireframes" src="images/event-bites-logo-preference-test.png" alt=""/>

   <p>Based on the preference test results 23% picked option 1, 31% picked option 2, 15% picked option 3, 31%
   picked option 4. Based on the supporting feedback Option 2 is clean and the graphic is a very clear direct tie-in to my word
   mark. It is also the most recognizable when it’s small, carries fun and celebration concept. It could be used as an icon,
   which I used as the caterer icon in tab bar throughout my design. In my final design, I picked Option 2 as Event Bites’ logo
   by making the text bigger, using all lower-case and making the graphic smaller.</p>

   <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/e9cf07a12ec0/results/a3e084daec2b" target="_blank" class="text-link">See logo preference test results</a>

   <p>I picked a warm yellow tone as a primary color to make Event Bites inviting and also to give the necessary party,
   celebration and fun feeling. I used a dark background to create a strong contrast with yellow and a tone of blue in certain
   optional elements as a secondary color to balance out the warm yellow throughout my design. I updated the prototype
   with selected images, logo, color, form and UI elements and created the final design mockups in Adobe XD.</p>

   <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
   <p>The final app design was well received and users liked seeing all the improvements based on their feedback. They loved the color palette, UI elements and the overall
  feel of the design. I came out of this project with a better understanding of Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines. As a result of this experience,
  I also learned that the Usability Testing plays a very important role in creating an intuitive design. I would have missed some of the important details
  in user flows without having our users critique. Majority of the changes I made between my first low fidelity prototype and my high-fidelity prototype
  were pretty drastic. Our users pain points surfaced during interviews and usability tests and allowed me to improve my design.</p>
