         complex solutions and busy dashboards. Most of the available tools on the market, such as
         Evernote and Pinterest allows saving a single type of content. There was definetely a demand for an application that is

        <h3>User Research and Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <div class="research">

          <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHO IS OUR AUDIENCE?</span></span></br>
          Our survey audience was a mix group of individuals including, but not limited to Engineers, Architects, Support and Training Specialists.
          They were between the ages of 25-34 years old, and located in New York and Boston. Based on the survey results over <span style="font-weight:bold;">70%</span> of our audience were
          professionals, who worked in a collaborative environment. Majority of them share resources with their coworkers and friends in regular basis.</P>


          <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHAT ARE THEIR LIKES AND DISLIKES?</span></span></br>
          Majority of our audience owned a smart phone along with a tablet and a laptop. They mentioned about browsing on their smart phones and also,
          on their laptops in addition to their smart phone. Social networks and news were the most popular sites consumed. Our users needed to access content in
          Blocbox from any device, which would require a responsive design. About <span style="font-weight:bold;">60%</span> of them saved content sometimes and about half of them downloaded icontent,
          but some of them bookmarked content on their browsers. They all mentioned about having difficulty with organizing and searching saved content.</p>

          <p class="results"><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="color: #000000">WHY DO THEY USE IT?</span></span></br>
          Some of our competitors are Smart Phone App, Evernote, Pinterest, Facebook and Trello based on the survey results. Our audience write notes-mainly for personal reasons, but some of them for business reasons.
          Most of them capture notes with smart phone apps. Another popular way that they use to capture notes is with Evernote. They mentioned how much they liked being able to access notes
          from anywhere easily. Also, being able to set reminders was an important feature for them. They think it's easy to acess these type of tools by connecting through a Facebook or a Twitter account.</p>

        <h5>Evernote</h5>
         <ul class="competitive">
          <li>Their basic plan is free and comes with 60 MB of new uploads per month.</li>
          <li>They provide rich-text notes, including highlighting, checklists and formatting.</li>
          <li>Evernote can be used on phone/computer and sync across devices.</li>

          <li>Users can attach files to notes: word, sheets, presentations, images, PDFs.</li>
          <li>Evernote has too many features/too complex for simple note taking and somewhat cluttered.</li>
        </ul>
       </div>

        <div class="col"><img class="doordash" src="images/notes-logo.png" alt=""/>
        <h5>Apple Notes</h5>
         <ul class="competitive">
          <li>It is completely free to use and it doesn’t require or consume iCloud storage space.</li>
          <li>Users can send notes to text message, messenger, mail, social media and third party apps.</li>
          <li>Users can create multiple folders, and assign content from various apps within a share sheet on Mac or iOS. No device limit.</li>
          <li>Users can share their notes directly to Reminders, and create “Apple Notes” lists within the Reminders app.</li>
          <li>There are no tags so no way of grouping notes together by tag across various folders and can't search for tags.</li>
         </ul>
       </div>

        <div class="col"><img class="ubereats" src="images/pinterest-logo.png" alt=""/>

       <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
         <ul class="paragraph-list">
          <li>Based on the survey results, user interviews and competitive analysis our application should be responsive to allow users to access content from any device.
          Users like being able to access notes from anywhere easily.</li>
          <li>Blocbox should also make managing and searching content easy by allowing grouping and categorizing saved content since majority
          of our user based mentioned this as one of their pain points.</li>
          <li>They like using reminders feature while using tools from competitors so we should consider
          offering “ability to set reminders” as one of Blocbox's features.</li>
          <li>Another important feature that they like to see in our application is a way for collaboration and ability to share items with others easily so I will make sure
          to incorporate this concept into my design.</li>
          <li>Considering that most of our users like social media and tend to forget their passwords Blocbox's design should include social
          registration for easy access.</li>
         </ul>


        <h3>User Stories and User Flows</h3>
        <p>According to the key takeaways I documented the user stories and prioritized them as High, Medium and Low. The High priority stories defined MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for Blocbox.
        Below you can see the high-priority user stories.</p>
            <ul class="paragraph-list">
              <li>As a User I want to find out more about Blocbox.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to create an account with my email address and password.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to create an account using Twitter, Facebook and Google.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to view my account profile.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to update my account profile.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to add, edit, view and delete a text-based note.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to add, edit, view and delete a link.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to add, edit, view and delete an image.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to create, edit, view and delete a box.</li>
              <li>As a User I want to upgrade, downgrade and cancel my account.</li>
              <li>As a User	I want to sign in using my email and password.</li>
              <li>As a User	I want to reset my password.</li>
              <li>As a User	I want to sign in using Facebook, Twitter and Google.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I drawed the user flow diagrams based on the defined user stories.</p>
             <img class="wireframes" src="images/blocbox-user-flow-diagram.png" alt=""/>


        <h3>Branding and Style Guide</h3>
         <p>The hexagone shape created the 3d box impression for Blocbox's concept of collecting and storing items in a box.
          I picked colors that could communicate the brand as simple, dependable, structured and serious while being friendly, warm, welcoming and trustworthy.
          The color palette consists of cold and warm tones to compliment each other. My intention was to make sure that everyone felt welcomed to Blocbox
          while carrying a structured application identity.</p>
          <img class="wireframes style" src="images/blocbox-style-guide.png" alt=""/>


        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
         <p>I created Blocbox's Low Fidelity wireframes and explored different layout variations in Balsamiq. I updated them with Blocbox's logo, content
         and fonts that I picked and created the High Fidelity wireframes.</p>
         <img class="wireframes" src="images/blocbox-high-fidelity-wireframe.png" alt=""/>
         <div class="button-link">

         </div>

         <h3>Usability Test Results</h3>
          <p>I used UserTest.IO and conducted usability tests with 4 users with the first version of the prototype. I asked them to perform a set of tasks. You can see a sample of these tasks below.</p>

            <ul class="paragraph-list task">
             <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span style="color: #62a18b"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> TASK 1:</span></span> How would you access and sign up for this product?</li>
             <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span style="color: #62a18b"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> TASK 2:</span></span> Are there other ways that you can use to access and sign up for this product? Are they sufficient options?</li>
             <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span style="color: #62a18b"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> TASK 3:</span></span> Now that you signed up and navigated to your dashboard for the first time. How can you add a piece of content?  What do you think “Add New” represent? What options are you provided? What do you think they are for? Explore each option.</li>
             <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span style="color: #62a18b"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> TASK 4:</span></span> Since you have already signed up and created an account. How would you sign in to your account?</li>
             <li><i class="fa fa-check-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> <span style="color: #62a18b"><span style="font-weight:bold;"> TASK 5:</span></span> What do you see on this page? What option would you use to sign in to your account? Do you think the available options are sufficient?</li>
           </ul>

          <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
          <p>Based on the feedback that I gathered during the usability tests I decided to make the following changes in my design.</p>

          <div class="flex-container">
           <div class="event-details">
            <h5>Design and Navigation</h5>
            <ul class="paragraph-list">
             <li>Users liked that Blocbox's design was simple and clean, but adding the content section was not grabbing their attention. They said that it could be due its being in grayscale.</li>
             <li>They tried to click on items on the left navigation bar and wondered about their purpose of use.</li>
             <li>Users wanted to be able to utilize search and looked for help options. There was no option to walk them through the tool as a tutorial or as a wizard.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="paragraph-list"><span style="color: #CA8331">Decisions:</span> There will be a notofication message at top when users visit Blocbox's dashboard for the first time to inform them about how they can add content.</div>
          </div>

          <div class="event-details">
           <h5>Product Purpose</h5>
           <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>Users were confused about the purpose of the product. They thought that there wasn't enough information about how they could use it. They were confused about the term “box.”</li>
            <li>They thought it might be a cloud storage tool. “It’s easy to navigate around, but what is this product? Is it like Dropbox?”</li>
            <li>They thought that it might be a data aggregation tool, mark down version of google docs. They suggested integrating it with google docs.</li>
           </ul>
           <div class="paragraph-list"><span style="color: #CA8331">Decisions:</span> Users captured the purpose of the product correctly. However, it is true that there are many products available
           with the same purpose of use. The content needs to cover what differentiates Blocbox from its competitors.</div>
         </div>
         </div>

         <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="event-details">
           <h5>Sign In/Sign Up and Account Settings</h5>
           <ul class="paragraph-list">
            <li>They thought that there were different ways to sign up for the product with all the “Get Started” options.</li>
            <li>They thought that the signup options were sufficient. Some suggested adding google as a sign in/sign up option.</li>
            <li>They thought the available options on the account settings were sufficient.</li>
            <li>About avatar image, they missed the “Edit” link. They wanted to click on the image to update their profile avatar image.</li>
           </ul>
           <div class="paragraph-list"><span style="color: #CA8331">Decisions:</span> The avatar image will be clickable to make it easy for users to update their account profile photo. Google Sign In/Sign Up option will be available.</div>
         </div>

         <div class="event-details">
          <h5>Dashboard</h5>
          <ul class="paragraph-list">
           <li>The message bar at top was avoiding users to access the “Add New” dropdown options. It was confusing that they had to close the message in order to click on the Add New button.</li>
           <li>They suggested making the boxes editable in addition to the edit icon. “Why can’t I click the whole thing to view and edit? I would expect that.”</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="paragraph-list"><span style="color: #CA8331">Decisions:</span> The message bar at top will not require to be closed and it will not avoid users to take an action on Dashboard page. The boxes will be editable.</div>
        </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Home Page and Dashboard</h3>
         <p>I performed a preference test by placing the "Add New" button next to the search field at top vs. placing it in the body of the Dashboard. The audience thought that either options were acceptable, about 41%
         preferred the "Add New" button in the body of the site instead of the header. Some thought that it was confusing to see it next to the search field.
         Since the preference test was not statistically different between them I decided to place it in the body of the site.
         </p>

          <img class="event-details sk2" src="images/blocbox-dashboard-preference.png" alt=""/>

          <p>I also performed a dashboard navigation test to see if users could click on the "Add New" button to upload an item on Dashboard easily. About a total 57% of participants completed the step successfully in an average of 4 seconds.</br>

          </p>

          <p>I performed a 5 second test for Blocbox's homepage to see whether users thought the brand appeared trustworthy. Majority of them found the site trustworthy and rated it as 4 and 5 out of 5 rating scale.</br>

          </p>

          <h3>Mockups</h3>
          <p>Based on the test results and the decided changes I created the mockups in Photoshop by adding Blocbox's colors, logo and images. I conducted usability tests with 3 users with the updated version of the prototype.
          Below you can see a link to one of the usability test session recordings as a sample and the final mockups.</p>

       <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>I developed a responsive home page and a dashboard for Blocbox to practice my coding skills. Here is a link to the code in <a href="https://github.com/gizemgaudet/Blocbox/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank" class="text-link github">GitHub</a>.
        As a result of this project, the product purpose was communicated succesfully because all users thought that the site was about collecting items similar to the the services that Blocbox's competitors provide. Users thought
        that the site looked very professional and reliable. They liked the design and the color palette. They said that everything they would want to see was there.
        They liked the idea of being able to use Blocbox for free without paying upfront and being able to save links compare to the other sites, where they were just allowed to save files. They mentioned that adding more information about
        the company, its mission statement and employees would have been great.
